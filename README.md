SimpleWebApp
============

Simple webpage I made for fun. Would have been simpler with frameworks but just wanted to see how fast I could do it without frameworks.
It uses jQuery and Javascript to create objects on screen that map to data in the an array. The objects can be played with and data changes accordingly.

Please ignore the bad structuring as of right now.
